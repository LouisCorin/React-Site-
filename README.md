In this Solo project, I have learned the basic React syntax.
I learned why it is composable and declarative, what the words mean and why it is beneficial for us as web developers.
I have learned what JSX syntax is and how it allows us to write code that is more familiar to us since it looks like basic HTML.
I have learned how to apply the composable nature of React by creating custom components and using CSS classes to add style to the page.
Everything came together creating my first static page with React and that  was a great introduction.

This Project was made from scratch at Scrimba.com. The html was made entirely with components in js. 
Here is the preview!
